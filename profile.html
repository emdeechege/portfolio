  <h1>Experience</h1>
  <p>I have a background in sales having pursued business administration-marketing- in my undergrad studies. I have worked in sales for the past six years. I have now decided to follow an interest I have had for a long time. I joined Moringa School to pursue programming before this lovely girls begin school.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I look forward to building stuff and solving societal problems through technology which is the most dynamic thing that is rapidly changing society and the way we view things. Some of the experimantal projects I have been engaging in in the past three days. They are all work in progress. Don't be too harsh!</p>
