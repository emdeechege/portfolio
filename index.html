  <h>Background</h>
  <p>Here is all where it begins.</p>
  <p>New dad, unemployed for eight months. Life is pushing blows thick and fast. It feels like I can't breath. A sales job lands my way, I have too much pressure and I am always looking for another opportunity. I switch jobs after only five months. I can't seem to settle down. Something keeps bugging me.</p>
  <p>A switch flicked, I made a decision. I am going back to school!!</p>
