  <h2>Background</h2><br>
  <p>Here is all where it begins.</p><br>
  <p class="p1"><span class="dad">New dad</span>, unemployed for eight months. Life is pushing blows thick and fast. It feels like I can't breath. A sales job lands my way, I have too much pressure and I am always looking for another opportunity. I switched jobs after only five months. I can't
    seem to settle down. Something keeps bugging me.</p>
  <p>A switch flicked, I made a decision. I was surely going back to school!!</p>
